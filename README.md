S3upload
========

This package provides a simple way of uploading files to the Amazon S3 service. This is useful for uploading images and files that you want accesible to the public. The package is built on [Knox](https://github.com/LearnBoost/knox), a module that becomes available server-side after installation.

Development in progress!
